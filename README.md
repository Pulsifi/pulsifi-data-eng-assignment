# Pulsifi Data Engineering Assignment
### Brief
Pulsifi's application helps organizations to improve talent acquisition and management by unifying and analyzing data, e.g. resumes, psychometric assessments, video interviews, etc. The main vision of Data Engineering team in Pulsifi is to create a data-driven culture by democratizing data. This in turn empowers every Pulsifian to access and harness the power of Pulsifi's data for informed decision-making without requiring technical intervention. The management of Pulsifi believes that the solution to materializing the main vision of Data Engineering team hinges on the development of a data platform as a service.

Within Pulsifi data ecosystem, we have data sources as follows:
* database, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, is used serve the Pulsifi Application
* third-party software, such as [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/?ref=431) and [SurveySparrow](https://surveysparrow.com/), is integrated within the Pulsifi Application
* Google Analytics and Google Tag Manager, is used to track user's behavior and journey within Pulsifi Application


### Objective
Recommend a flexible, fault-tolerant, cost-efficient, scalable, secure and high-performance data platform that can empower every Pulsifian to access the mentioned data in "Brief" section.

The solution should include the following:
* Data ingestion and processing data flow/pipeline
* Storage and Analytics architecture topology using data services and tools, preferably cloud services, such as GCP, AWS or Azure
* Cost flexibility - Explain how the solution will adapt to changing business requirements and keep cost manageable
* Proposal for the type of presentation layer or reporting mechanism will be supported by the solution

### Deliverables
A PDF document no more than 4 pages in length. The document should succinctly present analysis and recommendations to meet the requirements. All assumptions made during the design should be explicitly stated along with the cloud services consumed.
